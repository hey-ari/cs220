For this assignment you will be implementing two functions make_postage and permutations.

makepostage(money): This recursive function returns the number of three cent and five cent stamps that are needed to make postage of the given amount following the inductive proof presented in class. The return value is a tuple (numfive, numthree) that indicates the number of five cent and three cent stamps, respectively that together make up the given amount. For example, makepostage(15) will return the tuple (0, 5).

permutations(s): return all the permutations of a tuple of elements as a set. For example, permutations( (1,2) ) should return the set {(1, 2), (2, 1)}
