This third python programming assignment, PA3, is about counting. You will write two functions partitions(n,k) that counts in how many ways n distinct elements can be grouped into k (non empty) partitions, and mkCh(a,c) that counts in how many ways amount a can be paid with coins {1,5,10,25}. Both algorithms are discussed in lecture 15: counting.

Start with the skeleton code. A correct implementation of counting:

   python3 counting.py 3 2
   
produces

  n: 3 k: 2 partitions: 3
  amount: 32 coins: [1, 5, 10, 25] ways: 18
